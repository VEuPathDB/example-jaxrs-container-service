  # Definition of a single container in this stack.
  #
  # The name "example" will be the address other containers in the stack use to
  # connect to this service using the internal docker network (http://example).
  #
  # Each container in the Docker compose stack will need a service entry.
  example:
    # The "image" field tells which image to use for this container; in this
    # case, it does not have a group prefix since the example service is only
    # built locally.
    image: example-service:latest

    # Configure this service to be accessible via the external traefik network.
    # See "networks" below.

    # The "environment" field defines a map of environment variables that will
    # be passed to the service container on startup.

    # Fields that do not have a value or default value provided here will be
    # required on docker-compose startup.
